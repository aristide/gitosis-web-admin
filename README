Todo
* Git integration
* Improve deletion processes (destructive)
* serve public key from app
* Ajaxify submits

Advanced features (planned)
* Send mail notification to repository owner if anything related changes
* Send mail to key owner if anything related changes


Notes
* Config and database are loosely coupled. Config is regenerated from database all the time. Manual changes in the config will be lost.
* This only works with a fresh gitosis installation
